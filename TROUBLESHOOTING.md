# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - MODORA

## 🚨 Loading Page Issue - FIXED

### Problem: App stuck on loading page
**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**

The issue was in the authentication flow logic. The app was getting stuck in an infinite loading state due to incorrect state management.

### What was fixed:
1. **Fixed loading state logic** in `App.tsx`
2. **Added timeout protection** (10 seconds) to prevent infinite loading
3. **Added comprehensive error handling** for Firebase connection issues
4. **Added debugging logs** to track authentication flow
5. **Created fallback components** for connection errors

### Current Flow:
1. App starts → Shows loading page
2. Firebase initializes → Checks for existing user
3. If user exists → Shows main app
4. If no user → Shows auth page
5. If error → Shows error fallback with retry option

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:
- `AuthContext: Starting Firebase auth listener...`
- `AuthContext: Firebase auth state changed:`
- `Firebase connection test result: SUCCESS/FAILED`

### 2. Check Firebase Connection
The app now includes automatic Firebase connection testing. Look for these console messages:
```
Firebase configuration check:
- Auth initialized: true
- Firestore initialized: true
- Auth app: [DEFAULT]
- Firestore app: [DEFAULT]
```

### 3. Network Issues
If you see connection errors:
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase project is active
- Check if Firebase services are down

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Connection timeout"
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Try again in a few minutes

### Issue 2: "Failed to connect to our services"
**Solution:**
- Check if Firebase project is active
- Verify Firebase configuration
- Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue 3: Authentication not working
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check if email/password are correct

### Issue 4: Posts not loading
**Solution:**
- Check Firestore security rules
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors

## 🔧 Manual Testing

### Test Firebase Connection
```javascript
// In browser console
import { testFirebaseConnection } from './utils/firebaseTest';
testFirebaseConnection().then(result => console.log('Connection:', result));
```

### Test Authentication State
```javascript
// In browser console
import { auth } from './config/firebase';
console.log('Current user:', auth.currentUser);
```

## 📱 Mobile Issues

### iOS Safari Issues
- Clear Safari cache
- Disable content blockers
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

### Android Chrome Issues
- Clear app data
- Update Chrome browser
- Check permissions

## 🌐 Deployment Issues

### Netlify Build Failures
1. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Node.js version (should be 18+)

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

## 🚀 Performance Issues

### Slow Loading
- Check bundle size (currently ~727KB)
- Consider code splitting
- Optimize images and assets

### Firebase Performance
- Check Firebase console for usage limits
- Monitor Firestore read/write operations
- Consider caching strategies
